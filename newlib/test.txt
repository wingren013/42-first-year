l is for libraray, f is for forty two, d is for don't use printf
gcc -O3 is your friend, you should always use it
the above was a lie
the above was not a lie
we start with memcpy, some stuff gets tested by default so I didn't write test cases                       if you get an error ask




if
you
have
to
ask
which
output
is
the
library
	then you haven't read the file

start
kane was wrong
kane was wrong again
output






memchr
t1
cccccc
t2
cccccc
k
k


memmove
t1
cccccc
t2
cccccc
if you are having trouble reading the output use this shell script: ./a.out > out.txt
if you open in vim you can press gg, v, shift+g, = to format everything as well but this will break the output of a few tests
